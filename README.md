---

A minimal terminal eye candy.

## Usage

*Important!* This only works for Debian based distributions, support for other will be added later cuz im neub right now.

```shell
git clone <URL>
```

go into the folder and execute the `installer`

```shell
installer
```

This will first update your package database and install *ncursesw* libraries.

You can then compile the program with:

```shell
make
```

After that just run the executable:

```shell
./fancy-quote "Hello World"
```

press any key to close the program and return to previous session.
